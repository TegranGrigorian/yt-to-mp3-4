Hello!

This is my Youtube to Mp3 and Mp4 Converter project!

I wanted to write this project because all the Yt converters are either sketchy websites or software I dont want to install.

This project is completley open source and written by me. Anyone can download it or improve it. 

Im also using this project to learn Rust, I want to be a systems engineer and leverage Rust's benefits in error handeling and type saftey

This project should be used for anyone by anyone, I wrote this project using Rust OOP so it could also be used as a libary or include in someone elses project if needed!

Im currently enjoying the programming laungauge alot and I hope to continue using rust for the devolpment of this app.

Eventually I will add a installer for windows and linux so supportes or people who want to use this project dont need to build it with the rustc.

Lastly, this is currently in BETA, I want to eventually add a frontend gui for the user to configure the tool for what ever needs they want. The current configurations I want to add is
  Mp3, Mp4 or different file type
  Download Quality
  Download Speed(if possible, decrease quality or something)
  Download albums
  Download Playlists
  Please tell me what other suggestions I should add

Thank you for reading! Have a good day
